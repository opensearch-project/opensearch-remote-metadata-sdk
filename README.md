# OpenSearch Remote Metadata SDK for Java

This repository hosts the OpenSearch Remote Metadata SDK for Java.

The purpose of this SDK is to enable the creation of wrapper clients abstracting the storage of metadata which has historically been put in system indices.

Current implementations include a default (matching existing NodeClient system indices), remote OpenSearch cluster, and DynamoDB.  Additional client implementations are welcome!

For usage instructions, see the [DEVELOPER_GUIDE](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).
